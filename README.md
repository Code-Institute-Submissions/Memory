To add files to the repository take the following steps

In the command line type -
        git add .  
        git commit -m "This is being committed"
        git push

#### Deployment 
The project was deployed with the following steps

* Logged into git hub
* Clicked the "Settings" button in the menu above the Repository.
* Scroll down the Settings page to the "GitHub Pages" Section.
* Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and then select "Master Branch".
* The page will automatically refresh, and a link displaced.  It may take some time for the link to show the website.
* If the page will not load go down to "template" under the "source" and select a template. 
* Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.
* Website gets automatically updated on every commits push from master branch

#### Forking
By forking the GitHub Repository, you can make a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.  This means we can view or make changes without making the changes affecting the original.

* Log into GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
* At the top of the Repository there is a "Fork" button about the "Settings" button on the menu.
* You should now have a new copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.

### Cloning
